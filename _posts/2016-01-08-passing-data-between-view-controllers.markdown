The first time I tried to use a table view this problem came up almost immediately: how do I tell the detail view which cell I tapped on? As it turned out, there are several ways of doing this and it doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re using a table view or a simple button.

### Storyboard segues

This is an easy and straightforward way of passing data around using hooks provided by the SDK.

Weâ€™ll be using two methods that UIViewController provides to work with segues: `performSegueWithIdentifier:id:sender` and `prepareForSegue:segue:sender`. But first, we need to create the segue itself (duh ðŸ˜‰):

![]()

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
