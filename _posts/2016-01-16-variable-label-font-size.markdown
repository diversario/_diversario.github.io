When you use a `UILabel` to display a variable amount of text sometimes you want it to increase or decrease the font size to either fit more text or fill the label with a short snippet.

You can achieve this by using the **Autoshrink** label property:

Here, my 60pt font label is allowed to decrease its font size down to 10pt when the content does not fit into it. And it works:

Easy! ðŸ™Œ
